# Control Surfaces: Target Groups and Macros

*Spec version 1; caps v9, directory V18. Companion to
`control_surfaces_spec.md`, which remains authoritative for everything a
single-target binding already did.*

Groups let one physical control (or IR command via a macro, or macro step)
address a named set of channels as a unit: mute a speaker group, trim gain or
delay on a stereo pair, light an LED when any (or every) member satisfies a
condition. Macros let a button-shaped event fire a short, optionally delayed
sequence of parameter changes: select an input and load a preset, switch
monitor A/B, run a timed mute sequence.

Both features ride the existing engine unchanged in kind: every resulting
parameter change still dispatches the same vendor command a host would send,
through `vendor_dispatch_set/get` with `CTRL_SOURCE_GPIO`. Nothing in this
feature adds a new path to the audio pipeline, so preset loads, input
switches and output-config changes triggered from a macro inherit the
existing deferred, pipeline-safe apply machinery. Output slot alignment is
untouched by construction.

## 1. Concepts

### 1.1 Groups

A group is `{target_kind, member_mask, name}` in one of 8 device-global
slots. `target_kind` uses the existing `CS_TARGET_*` channel spaces
(`INPUT_CH`, `OUTPUT_CH`, `DSP_CH`); bit N of `member_mask` = channel N of
that space. Groups are pure configuration: they are created and edited by
the host (Console), persisted with the rest of the CS config, and referenced
by bindings, and macro steps, through a flag.

A binding references a group by setting `CS_FLAG_GROUP` (0x20) in `flags`;
`target` then carries the group index instead of a channel index. The
binding's noun must be targeted, and the group's kind must be compatible
with the noun's target kind:

| Noun `target_kind`  | Accepted group kind |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| `CS_TARGET_INPUT_CH`  | `CS_TARGET_INPUT_CH`  |
| `CS_TARGET_OUTPUT_CH` | `CS_TARGET_OUTPUT_CH` |
| `CS_TARGET_DSP_CH`    | `CS_TARGET_DSP_CH`    |
| `CS_TARGET_DSP_BAND`  | `CS_TARGET_DSP_CH` (binding `index` = band, validated per member) |

IR commands do not carry the GROUP flag in this revision (`IrCommand.flags`
still accepts only WRAP and REPEAT); a remote button reaches groups by
firing a macro whose steps use them.

### 1.2 Link laws (continuous nouns)

Two laws govern how members of a group relate under a continuous control:

- **Offset-preserving (default).** Relative ops (encoder `STEP`, button
  `INC`/`DEC`) step every member from its own value, so a balance trim
  between members survives. Absolute ops from a pot (`ADJUST`) move the
  *group mean* to the pot position while maintaining each member's offset
  from the mean, captured at the start of the gesture.
- **Absolute-identical (`CS_FLAG_LINK_ABS`, 0x40).** `ADJUST` drives every
  member to the same value. Only valid on `ADJUST` (it is the only action
  where the two laws differ; `SET` and `MOMENTARY` are inherently
  absolute-identical, `STEP`/`INC`/`DEC` inherently relative).

Clamping is per member against the noun's range: spinning far enough
compresses the members against the rail and the offset is progressively
lost, exactly like ganged faders on a console. Within one gesture session
(see 4.2) winding back restores the offsets; a new session captures whatever
the values then are.

Bool and enum nouns under a group use the **anchor rule**: the
lowest-numbered member is read as the anchor, the action is computed against
it (`TOGGLE` inverts the anchor, `INC`/`DEC`/`STEP` step it), and every
member is driven to the anchor's new value. A half-muted group therefore
becomes coherent on the first press.

### 1.3 Grouped indicators

`IND_EQUALS` / `IND_ABOVE` on a group evaluate the condition per member and
combine with OR by default (lit when *any* member matches);
`CS_FLAG_GROUP_ALL` (0x80) selects AND (*all* members). TON/TOF
`on_delay`/`off_delay` filtering applies to the combined condition.
`IND_LEVEL` (PWM brightness) follows the **maximum** member value; GROUP_ALL
is invalid there.

### 1.4 Macros

A macro is `{name, step_count, steps[8]}` in one of 8 device-global slots. A
step is a stripped binding: `{noun, action, flags, target, index, value,
step, pre_delay}` with the action subset `SET` / `TOGGLE` / `INC` / `DEC` /
`TRIGGER`, flags `WRAP` / `GROUP`, and a `pre_delay` in 10 ms
units (0..65535 = up to ~10.9 min) that elapses *before* the step executes.
Steps may target groups; steps may not fire macros (noun `CS_NOUN_MACRO` is
rejected in a step; no nesting).

Macros are fired through a new noun, `CS_NOUN_MACRO` (52): an enum of
`max_macros` positions accepting `SET` (fire macro `value`) and `IND_EQUALS`
(LED lit while macro `value` is running). Any button gesture, or IR command
can therefore fire a macro with no structural change to `CsBinding` or
`IrCommand`. `REQ_CS_MACRO_FIRE` gives hosts and external MCUs the same
trigger. The live read of the noun is the running macro's index, or 255
when idle (matches no `IND_EQUALS` comparand).

**Sequencer semantics.** One macro runs at a time. Firing a macro while one
is running cancels the running one at its current step boundary (remaining
steps are dropped, the in-flight step is not rolled back) and starts the new
one; firing the *same* macro restarts it. An empty macro (`step_count` 0) is
a no-op. Steps execute in order on the 1 kHz CS tick; each step's dispatch
honours the BUSY-retry machinery, so a step landing during a flash write
waits rather than being lost. Steps are re-validated at fire time; a step
that no longer validates (e.g. its group was since emptied or re-kinded) is
skipped, not fatal.

## 2. Wire reference

All multi-byte fields little-endian, as everywhere in the vendor protocol.

### 2.1 `CsGroup` (40 bytes)

| Offset | Size | Field | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| 0 | 1 | `target_kind` | `CS_TARGET_INPUT_CH`/`OUTPUT_CH`/`DSP_CH`; 0 = slot empty |
| 1 | 3 | `reserved` | write 0 |
| 4 | 4 | `member_mask` | bit N = channel N; 32-bit (RP2350 DSP space is 17 channels) |
| 8 | 32 | `name` | NUL-terminated, same convention as slot names |

Empty slot = all-zero record (strict, like binding clears). A non-empty
group must have a valid kind, a non-zero mask, and no mask bits at or above
the platform's channel count for that kind.

### 2.2 `CsGroupConfig` (324 bytes, flash)

`{uint8 version (=1); uint8 reserved[3]; CsGroup groups[8]}`. All-zero =
no groups; a fresh directory needs no seeding.

### 2.3 `CsMacroStep` (12 bytes)

| Offset | Size | Field | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| 0 | 1 | `noun` | any noun accepting the step's action; not `CS_NOUN_MACRO` |
| 1 | 1 | `action` | `SET`/`TOGGLE`/`INC`/`DEC`/`TRIGGER` only |
| 2 | 1 | `flags` | `CS_FLAG_WRAP` \| `CS_FLAG_GROUP` |
| 3 | 1 | `target` | channel, or group index when GROUP set |
| 4 | 1 | `index` | band for `DSP_BAND` nouns, else 0 |
| 5 | 1 | `reserved` | write 0 |
| 6 | 2 | `value` | as `CsBinding.value` |
| 8 | 2 | `step` | as `CsBinding.step` (INC/DEC size; 0 = default) |
| 10 | 2 | `pre_delay` | 10 ms units before this step runs |

An all-zero record is an empty step (skipped). `LINK_ABS` is meaningless in
the step action subset and rejected.

### 2.4 `CsMacro` (132 bytes) and `CsMacroConfig` (1060 bytes, flash)

`CsMacro` = `{char name[32]; uint8 step_count; uint8 reserved[3];
CsMacroStep steps[8]}`. Execution uses `steps[0..step_count-1]`.
`CsMacroConfig` = `{uint8 version (=1); uint8 reserved[3]; CsMacro
macros[8]}`. All-zero = no macros.

### 2.5 `CsMacroHeaderWire` (36 bytes)

`{char name[32]; uint8 step_count; uint8 reserved[3]}`; the SET payload for
a macro's name and length (steps are SET individually; the 64-byte vendor
control buffer cannot carry a whole 132-byte macro).

### 2.6 `CsExtStatusPacket` (24 bytes)

| Offset | Size | Field |
|--------|------|-------|
| 0 | 1 | `max_groups` (8) |
| 1 | 1 | `max_macros` (8) |
| 2 | 1 | `max_macro_steps` (8) |
| 3 | 1 | `macro_running` (index, 0xFF = idle) |
| 4 | 1 | `macro_step` (current step index while running) |
| 5 | 3 | `reserved` |
| 8 | 8 | `group_status[8]` (stored-record validity, `CS_STATUS_*`/0) |
| 16 | 8 | `macro_status[8]` (worst step validity, `CS_STATUS_*`/0) |

`CsStatusPacket` (41 bytes) and every pre-existing GET response are
**byte-identical to caps v8**; external clients doing exact-length readback
(the ESP32 front panel) are unaffected until they opt into the new
commands.

### 2.7 Caps v9

`CsCapsHeader` stays 40 bytes; the three former `reserved` bytes after
`max_ir_commands` become `max_groups`, `max_macros`, `max_macro_steps` (a
pre-v9 host read them as zeros). `caps_version` = 9. `noun_count` grows to
53 (`CS_NOUN_MACRO`).

## 3. Commands (`0x20`-`0x26`)

All follow the existing CS conventions: SETs are deferred single-deep
handoffs applied on the main loop with results in `cs_last_status` /
`cs_last_slot`; applies are live-only previews; `REQ_CS_SAVE` persists the
whole CS config (now including groups and macros) in one directory write and
`REQ_CS_REVERT` restores the stored one; the shared dirty flag covers all of
it. `cs_last_slot` tags: `0x40 | group` for group SETs, `0x60 | macro` for
macro header and step SETs (IR keeps `0x80 | sub`).

| Cmd | Name | Dir | wValue | Payload / response |
|-----|------|-----|--------|--------------------|
| 0x20 | `REQ_SET_CS_GROUP` | SET | group 0-7 | 40-byte `CsGroup`; all-zero clears |
| 0x21 | `REQ_GET_CS_GROUP` | GET | group 0-7 | 40-byte live `CsGroup` |
| 0x22 | `REQ_SET_CS_MACRO` | SET | macro 0-7 | 36-byte `CsMacroHeaderWire` |
| 0x23 | `REQ_GET_CS_MACRO` | GET | macro 0-7 | 132-byte live `CsMacro` |
| 0x24 | `REQ_SET_CS_MACRO_STEP` | SET | `(step << 8) \| macro` | 12-byte `CsMacroStep`; all-zero clears |
| 0x25 | `REQ_CS_MACRO_FIRE` | GET-style | macro 0-7; 0xFFFF = cancel | 1 status byte |
| 0x26 | `REQ_GET_CS_EXT_STATUS` | GET | 0 | 24-byte `CsExtStatusPacket` |

Recommended edit order for hosts: write steps first, header (with the final
`step_count`) last, so a concurrently-fired macro never sees a length that
exceeds its written steps. Fire-time revalidation makes a torn edit
skip-safe, not crash-prone, regardless.

New status codes: `CS_STATUS_INVALID_GROUP` 0x1F (bad/empty/mismatched
group reference), `CS_STATUS_INVALID_MACRO` 0x20 (bad macro index or
`step_count`), `CS_STATUS_INVALID_STEP` 0x21 (step record invalid).

## 4. Engine semantics

### 4.1 Group fan-out and BUSY retry

A grouped op computes every member's absolute target up front, then
dispatches member-by-member in the same tick. Members whose dispatch
reports BUSY stay in a per-slot pending mask and retry each tick. New
detents arriving while members are pending fold into the same op (the
accumulated delta updates every member's target and re-queues all members),
so no input is lost and no member double-steps. Grouped filter-noun ops
share the single EQ pending packet, so members trickle out one per EQ apply
cycle; this is milliseconds and invisible at human speed.

### 4.2 Gesture sessions (replacing per-member shadows)

Relative grouped ops and offset-preserving `ADJUST` run in a *session*: at
the first event after idle (or after `CS_GROUP_SESSION_TICKS` = 500 ms
without events) the engine captures each member's live value as its base
(and, for `ADJUST`, the group mean at capture), then accumulates one delta
for the whole session; targets are always `clamp(base_m + delta)` (log
units: `base_m * 2^delta`). This keeps rapid detents from coalescing
against stale live values of deferred-apply nouns (the job the single-target
shadow does), without per-member shadow state.

### 4.3 Momentary on a group

`MOMENTARY` on a grouped bool captures every member's value at the press,
drives all members to `value`, and restores each member on release; the
restore also runs when the binding is torn down mid-hold (rebind, revert).
As part of this change the single-target teardown path gained the same
best-effort restore (previously only IR commands had it), so no momentary
of any kind can strand a parameter at its held value.

### 4.4 Group edits and dependents

Applying a group SET re-validates every active binding that references any
group. A binding that no longer validates (group emptied, kind changed,
band index invalid for a new member) is deactivated with its failure in
`slot_status`, exactly like a stored binding that fails at boot; it
reactivates automatically when a later group SET makes it valid again.
There is no in-use refusal. A running macro is not cancelled by a group
edit; its later steps simply revalidate at execution.

### 4.5 Macro execution

The sequencer owns one op-state and one group context. Per step: wait out
`pre_delay`, revalidate, resolve the action exactly as a button press on an
equivalent binding would (anchor rule, group fan-out included), then wait
for the step's dispatches to leave the BUSY-pending state before starting
the next step's delay. Cancellation (new fire, `REQ_CS_MACRO_FIRE` 0xFFFF,
or revert) drops remaining steps; anything already dispatched stands.

## 5. Persistence (directory V18)

`PresetDirectory` gains `cs_groups` (324 B) then `cs_macros` (1060 B)
appended after `cs_ir`, total directory ~2955 bytes of the 4096-byte
sector. `DIR_VERSION_CURRENT` = 18. The V17 layout is byte-identical to the
V18 prefix, so the V17 to V18 migration is a prefix copy with zeroed new
blobs (= no groups, no macros), following the V16 to V17 pattern, with a
frozen `PresetDirectory_v17` snapshot and static asserts pinning the
geometry. Sanitizers bound-check the blob versions, `target_kind` and
`step_count` on load, zeroing implausible entries; `member_mask` range and
step records are platform-dependent and validate at apply / fire time
instead.

Boot order: groups and macros load before bindings (bindings validate
against groups). Factory reset and preset load/save do not touch them;
like all CS config they are device-global.

## 6. Validation summary

Binding (`cs_validate` additions):
- `CS_FLAG_GROUP`: noun must be targeted; `target` < 8; group non-empty;
  kind compatible per the 1.1 table; for `DSP_BAND` nouns, `index` must be a
  valid band for **every** member; `TRIGGER` never grouped (no targeted
  trigger nouns exist).
- `CS_FLAG_LINK_ABS`: requires GROUP + `ADJUST` + continuous noun.
- `CS_FLAG_GROUP_ALL`: requires GROUP + `IND_EQUALS`/`IND_ABOVE`.
- Without GROUP, the three new bits must be 0 (strict, as ever).

Group SET: kind in {1,2,3} or all-zero clear; mask non-zero and inside the
platform channel count; reserved bytes 0.

Macro header SET: `step_count` <= 8; reserved 0. Step SET: action in the
step subset; noun accepts it (per the caps noun mask, button column);
noun != `CS_NOUN_MACRO`; flags subset WRAP|GROUP; target/index valid
(channel or group, same rules as bindings); value/step bounds per
`cs_validate_values`. Steps also revalidate at fire time and skip on
failure.

## 7. RAM and platform notes

Live tables (groups 324 B + macros 1060 B), per-slot group contexts
(pending mask, session base per DSP channel), and the macro sequencer add
roughly 3 KB BSS on RP2350 and 2.5 KB on RP2040 (fewer channels). Both
platforms get the full feature; the only platform difference is channel
counts, which flow from the existing noun descriptors.
